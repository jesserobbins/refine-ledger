## [0.0.1-alpha] — 2026-06-25

First alpha. Packages the **Robo Refine and Polish** discipline as a standalone,
self-installing Claude Code plugin.

### Added

- The `refine-and-polish` skill (`skills/refine-and-polish/SKILL.md`) — the full
  discipline for tracking a multi-iteration roborev refine loop in a private
  ledger: typed findings (`NEW` / `REGRESSION` / `REPEAT` / `LOOP`), the
  deliberate-pushback list, reviewer-coverage caveats, an explicit convergence
  criterion and iteration budget, and the honest "budget stop" for an unbounded
  Low-severity tail.
- Plugin packaging: `plugin.json` and a self-contained `marketplace.json`, so the
  repo installs as its own marketplace.
- A [worked example](./docs/example-ledger.md) — a real three-iteration loop with
  a filled-in ledger, a pushback entry, and an honest convergence caption.
- README quickstart and an alpha-status note.

### Known limitations

- The two-step marketplace install matches the documented plugin flow and working
  plugins, but has not been run end-to-end by a fresh user.
- Requires the [roborev](https://roborev.io) CLI; this is a discipline layered on
  top of it, not a standalone tool.
- Assumes subscription-backed reviewers; the "reviewer unavailable" handling
  deliberately refuses API-key fallback.
